# Design Patterns Demonstration

This project demonstrates six common design patterns in Java: Observer, Strategy, Singleton, Factory Method, Adapter, and Decorator.

## Project Structure

- `src/com/designpatterns/demo/ConsolidatedDesignPatterns.java`: Contains all the design pattern implementations and demonstrations.

## Design Patterns Implemented

1. **Observer Pattern**: Demonstrates a weather station notifying displays about weather changes.
2. **Strategy Pattern**: Shows different sorting algorithms (Bubble Sort and Quick Sort) being used interchangeably.
3. **Singleton Pattern**: Implements a configuration manager with a single instance.
4. **Factory Method Pattern**: Creates different types of documents (PDF and Word) using creator classes.
5. **Adapter Pattern**: Adapts a legacy rectangle drawing method to a new shape interface.
6. **Decorator Pattern**: Adds various condiments to a coffee order, modifying its description and cost.

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
2. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE (e.g., Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA).
3. Navigate to `src/com/designpatterns/demo/ConsolidatedDesignPatterns.java`.
4. Run the `main` method in the `ConsolidatedDesignPatterns` class.

## Output

The program will demonstrate each design pattern in turn, printing the results to the console.

## Extending the Project

To add more design patterns or modify existing ones:

1. Add new methods in the `ConsolidatedDesignPatterns` class for additional patterns.
2. Implement the necessary classes and interfaces for new patterns.
3. Call your new demonstration methods from the `main` method.

## Notes

- This project consolidates all patterns into a single file for simplicity.
- The implementations are kept simple to focus on the core concepts of each design pattern.
